How to connect from Vsccode to GCP VM 
======================================

1. create ssh keys in local machine 
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f $HOME/.ssh/<key-name> -C <user-name>
ex: ssh-keygen -t rsa -f $HOME/.ssh/gcp -C vamsikaravipati58

2. config file create under .ssh that was genarated

Host <any name>
HostName <external-ip-gcp>
    User <gcp user>
    IdentityFile <path of key(private key)>


Host my-gcp-vm
HostName 35.244.54.193
    User vamsikaravipati58
    IdentityFile /home/affine/.ssh/gcp
   
3. we gave path to a private key which means it can be accesd with a public key 
   now we have to add a public key to the GCP VM 
   we will add a project level keys here 
   ( goto compute engine >settings > metadata > ssh keys > (add public key here
  
4. Vscode Extensions > Remote SSH (install)
   ctrl +shift +p 
   type "remote ssh: add new host"
   after that connect to ssh config 
   (path that you created it will show)
